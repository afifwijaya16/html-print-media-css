    <!-- 3.1 Section 1 - Foreword -->
    <h2 class="no-break top">Foreword</h2>
    <p>HTML and CSS are beautiful languages and one of the landmark achievements of collaboration and the open web.
        Together, they allow you to create beautifully typeset digital content that can be viewed on any device, without
        any special software or paid licenses.

    <p>The web however was developed for scrolling content, and not paged media (by which we mean discrete pages, like
        in print or PDF). Unfortunately, whilst there are <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-page-3/">W3C standards</a>
        on paged media, adoption by browsers has not been adequate to date. High quality paid alternatives exist in <a
            href="https://www.princexml.com">PrinceXML</a>, but a native, free solution has been missing.</p>

    <p>A <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26578826">happenstance discussion</a> on Hacker News brought my
        attention to <a href="https://www.pagedjs.org">paged.js</a>, a genius idea to polyfill the required capabilities
        to allow browsers to natively handle paged media, without having to build the whole rendering engine from
        scratch.</p>

    <p>This guide provides a basic tutorial to using paged.js, for my own future reference and yours, and I highly
        recommend you visiting their site and supporting their project. In particular, their <a
            href="https://www.pagedjs.org/documentation/05-designing-for-print/">documentation</a> covers many aspects
        of advanced paged media and is a worthwhile next step after reading this guide.</p>

    <!-- 3.2 Section 2 - Getting Started -->
    <h2 class="top">Getting Started</h2>
    <h3 class="top">Installation</h3>
    <p>There are three elements required to producing PDFs from HTML through paged.js. First, you will need to load the
        <a href="https://www.pagedjs.org/documentation/releases/">paged.polyfill.js</a> library either by hosting it
        locally or linking to it directly:
    </p>

    <code><pre>
    &lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/pagedjs/dist/paged.polyfill.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    </pre></code>

    <p>Second, you will need to have a web server as paged.js works by modifying your underlying HTML and CSS. One way
        is to host statically on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> (or similar), another is use a
        local server like <a
            href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb">Web
            Server for Chrome</a>.</p>

    <p>Finally, you need to have your own custom stylesheet where you will enter all the formatting rules to apply. In
        our example repo, these rules are contained within <a
            href="https://github.com/ashok-khanna/pdf/blob/main/style.css">style.css</a>.</p>

    <h3>Alternate (easier) Installation</h3>
    <p>As an easier alternative, simply clone my <a href="https://github.com/ashok-khanna/pdf">example repo</a> (and set
        up GitHub Pages for the cloned repo) and then read through <light-mark>style.css</light-mark> and <light-mark>
            index.html</light-mark> to understand how it works. The rest of this guide takes you through the code
        example in my repo.</p>

    <h3>Media Queries</h3>
    <p>Before we begin with the main guide, I want to quickly introduce you to <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries">media queries</a>.
        Media queries allow us to modify the stylesheet associated with our website depending on whether it is viewed on
        screen or for print (e.g. when printing to PDF or paper) and allow us to set different style sheets for print,
        screen and mobile.</p>

    <p>A common use case for media queries is to hide navigational menus from a print or mobile view. Say we have
        defined a class <light-mark>sidebar</light-mark>, we could hide it from a print view, whilst keeping it visible
        in the primary screen view, as follows.</p>

    <code><pre>
    @media print { 
      .sidebar { display: none; }
    }
    </pre></code>

    <p>Whilst we will not make use of media queries in the rest of this guide and in the example repo, please do
        remember them and use them liberally to create distinct views for screen, print and mobile based on your
        requirements. They are a central component of responsive web design, a topic we could dedicate an entire book
        to, but not one for today.</p>

    <!-- 3.2 Section 2 - Getting Started -->
    <table class="banner-logo">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="https://www.logodesign.net/images/home-page-logo-03.png" alt="Logo" height="100px"
                    width="100px">
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <table class="banner-title">
        <tr>
            <td>Nama</td>
            <td>:</td>
            <td>Afif Wijaya</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Nama</td>
            <td>:</td>
            <td>Afif Wijaya</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Nama</td>
            <td>:</td>
            <td>Afif Wijaya</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <div class="banner-class">

        <h3 class="top">Banners</h3>
        <p>We can also create banners at the top or bottom of our pages with some more advanced CSS. Below is a hacky
            example, there is probably a cleaner way to do this.</p>

        <figure>
            <figcaption>Creating Custom Pages with Banners</figcaption>
            <code><pre>
    <b>In CSS</b>:
    
    @page top-banner {
      @top-left-corner { background-color: #445a75; content: " "; }
      @top-left { background-color: #445a75; content: " "; }
      @top-center {
        background-color: #445a75; 
        color: white;
        content: "Sample Banner Text";
      }
      @top-right { background-color: #445a75; content: " "; }
      @top-right-corner { background-color: #445a75; content: " "; }
    }
    
    .banner-class { page: top-banner; }
    
    
    <b>In HTML</b>:
    
    &lt;div class="banner-class"&gt;Content Goes Here&lt;div&gt;
    </pre></code>
